# Brewdog Beer Randomizer
Discover a random beer of Brewdog's. This small website is used as a demonstation of what you can build using just 3 files: HTML, CSS and JS. The website is designed to be mobile-first. Majority of the code is typed from scratch without the use of fancy libraries. It uses [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2), which is an unofficial brewdog API. The fonts are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

Feel free to clone the repo and expand on the functionalities üçª

If you find anything broken, please open an issue and I will asssess whether it is a core need that needs to be fixed. Also, feel free to open PR's; I'm more than happy to take a look at extra functionalities to expand this repo, however keep in mind I am keeping to the 3 files rule.
